    <h2> Owen Heap </h2>
    <p>Hello! my name is Owen. I'm from San Diego California. I am studying computer science. <p>        
    </p>I love to do things outdoors like hiking and traveling. This picture was from a recent hike I did over spring break in Logan, Utah. I also love sports, I played baseball, soccer, and golf growing up but im a huge fan of pretty much any sport. </p>
    </p> I'm excited to be able to learn lots of new skills in this class!</p>
